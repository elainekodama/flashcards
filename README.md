# Mobile Flashcards

Studies have shown that writing out notes rather than typing is a more efficient way of studying, but paper flashcards cause tons of paper waste, if not being very inefficient.
This is an iOS application in which users can create flashcards sets without that issue of one-time paper use.
This application supports the iPad Pencil, so that ANY material can be handdrawn or handwritten, but also supports images and text.

This is programming in Swift using XCode, and implements the FireBase API and the MVC and delegation design pattern.

This was made as a final project for an iOS programming class, but is being worked on for deployment.
